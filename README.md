# Elkins Robotics/Electronics Club
This code repository is for all the coding things that we built when teaching our students electronics and robotics. The tools we use continues to prove that they engage the minds of children when used appropriately. As we progress, we think it would be wise to share the lessons we have learned with others so they can learn with us. 

## Prerequisites
 - [Micro:Bit Wiki pages](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.1/index.html)
 - [Mu-Editor](https://codewith.mu/en/)
   - [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) | Students do not use this in class, but some volunteers do and it works just as well
 - The desire to *learn*!
## Notes on our Development Environments
Our volunteers and students utilize Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, and occassonally Windows 10 operating systems for code development/testing. Most of our work is done in the linux environment, but a few of our students bring thier own laptops that have Windows.
