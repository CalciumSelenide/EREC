# MicroBit
This code repository is for all things involving the Micro:Bit that we built when teaching our students electronics and robotics. The Micro:Bit continues to prove itself as a wonderful platform to teach kids with, including the ability to teach them embedded programming with an easy to understand language: microPython. As we progress, we think it would be wise to share the lessons we have learned with others so that they can learn with us. 

## Notes on our Development Environments
Our volunteers and students utilize Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04 and occassonally Windows 10 operating systems for code development and testing. Most of our work is done in the linux environment, but a few of our students bring thier own laptops that have Windows 10.
