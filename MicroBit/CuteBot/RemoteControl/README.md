# Remote Control via Radio
These two pieces of code work together to form a remote control for the Micro:Bit cars. This allows students to wirelessly control thier cars and change the direction they travel by pressing the arrow keys on one's keyboard. The key presses (and releases) are sent so the car knows what action to perform and when to stop.
